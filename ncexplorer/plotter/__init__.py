"""
Package: plotter
---------------

A collection of classes for creating and working with plots of climate data.
This package contains classes for handling scatter plots and plots of data on
latitude and longitude coordinates.

The plotting library is built on Matplotlib.pyplot and the mpltoolkit Basemap.
Instead of simply linking to these libraries, this package implements a small
subset of the capability of these libraries and integrates them into a user
interface.

The projections supported are
    orthographic
    mercator
    lambert conformal
    lambert azimuthal (equal area).
